 <p>My amazing parents are my motivation! They're always sticking by my side and push me to go forward daily. Though, my mom suffers with cancer ,she's always encouraging me to be successful in life. My dad is the hardest working guy I know,and he always treats me like the lady I am and spoiles me. I am striving to do the best that I can now so that I can give back to my parents their wants and needs like they've done for me </p>
