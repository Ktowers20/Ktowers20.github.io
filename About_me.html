<p>  My name is Kadeesha.I was born March 19th,1996 at columbus Hospital.I was born and raised in Chicago,Il.Both my parents are a huge part of my life.I have 5 amazing siblings four brothers and one sister.After highschool, I was told to go to a trade school.I decided to pick cosmetolology as a trade not knowing I would love it so much.I only went to cosmetology school because I needed something to do,and I didn't want to just not work or go to college.Even though, I faced many obstacles during this time I was able to graduate from Empire Beauty school in September 2015 at the Stone Park location. Also, I passsed my stateboard exam in February 2016,which means I am now a licensed cosmetologist. This page will show you some of my recent styles I have done in my spare time.Though, I never had any background experience on hair, nails ,or make up,I was able enjoy it and be good at what I do. Cosmetology is now my side hustle,but I always will enjoy doing it each chance I get. </p>
